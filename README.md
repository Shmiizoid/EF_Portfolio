As a fellow member of the cohort, I want to see what Emilio's page will look like so I can provide feedback and ask questions regarding the code.

# Wireframes

![Landing page screengrab](/wireframep1.png)
My wireframes were very simplified, as intended. I ended up changing the nav bar because of I believed it provided a better UI. I would like to revisit the initial ideas once my skills improve.


# Unsolved Problems and Hurdles

I would have liked more styling on my page, but as is I have little experience and so fewer hands-on examples to pull from. My resume was supposed to be a pdf but I was unable to successfuly implement the pdf and so it remains an image in a modal.

I would say the carousel of images on my about page represented the greatest hurdle. It took quite a bit of problem solving to get it to the state it is currently.

I also would like for the ocntact page to have more functionality. Perhaps an auto response form my email.

Overall I am happy to have reached MVP, however in time I would like both the styling and functionality to improve and respresent the skills I develop over time.
